# __Post-it !__

## What is it ?

Pretty self explaining : it is a post-it web app.  
It has been built with React and SCSS as an exercise to practice this JavaScript framework.

## How to run it ?

`yarn start` or `npm start` will allow you to test the webapp on dev mode on your localhost (port 3000).
